This project that I did indepent of the class project wanted to dive into a theory I had.
Much of the analysis of emissions data generated no strong Linear relationship. I hypothosized that reason was because of trade.
My theory was that trade between countries can be directly tied to a reduction in emissions forone and an increase for the other.
I studied India's and the United States' trade data to discover they had a near perfect linear correlation.
